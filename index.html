            <p style="text-align: center; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width:50%; text-align: justify;"> When reading Othello you can feel that Othello gets less time to 
                speak his mind than other titular characters we studied in this class like Hamlet and Richard III. Whereas Iago who is the antagonist of the story gets to speak 
                his thoughts to the audience frequently. As you journey through the play you can see the disrespect that other characters show towards Othello, and you feel his 
                own state deteriorating, but how can you prove these things quantitatively? Can you visualize them? For this final project I wanted to show how data science can 
                interact with literature to give us deeper understandings of a text from a quantitative perspective. As someone who has always been passionate about the 
                intersections of art and stem I thought this would be a good opportunity to present to others how visualization and machine learning can be used as interpretation tools. 
                Specifically I wanted to show how little space Othello is afforded to speak in his own play, and I wanted to investigate the sentiment of the lines in Othello to show 
                how the words of the text reflect the plot. </p>

            <p style="text-align: center; ; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width:60%; text-align: justify;">Hamlet, Richard III, and Othello are named after the a character of the play, 
                however unlike Hamlet and Richard III, the titular character of Othello is not the main character. Compare the cumulative words spoken by each of these characters shows how Othello trails behind the other characters. 
                By the end of their respective plays Hamlet has spoken almost double the amount of words Othello has (11537 words vs 8789 words)
            </p>
      </div> 

      <div>   
        <img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width:50%" src="titular_iago.png" alt="Line chart comparing words spoken ny titular characters and Iago in Shakespeare plays"> 
        <p style="text-align: center; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width:60%; text-align: justify;"> When reading Othello it is noticeable how we spend more time and space with other characters, 
            specifically the play’s antagonist Iago. Unlike Hamlet where we see Hamlet take actions to affect the plot we really only see Othello react to the plot. 
            The plot is instead being driven by Iago. Throughout the play the audience is given deep insight into Iago’s plans and motivations through his monologues and asides to other characters, 
            a privilege which is not afforded to Othello. <br />
            Iago and Othello speak the exact same number of time in the play (273) however Iago both appears in more scenes and has longer lines.
             Othello does have the longest line in the play at 344 words long, his speech to congress about the courtship of Desdemona.  <br />
            This project is an attempt to visualize and explore how Othello is erased from his own story. I present graphs which track the arc of the main character’s 
            dialogue throughout the play as well as using the natural language processing technique of sentiment analysis to examine how character’s attitudes change across the play. 
            </p>

          </div>
          <p style="text-align: center; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width:60%; text-align: justify;"> The scene where a character has the most lines is Othello 
            in the final scene of the play with 69 lines with an average of 20 words per line. Othello also has the greatest average length of line in a scene with an average of 86 words 
            over 10 lines in 1.3, the high average is due to his monologue to the senators about his courtship with Desdemona. <br />
            The characters with the most lines in Othello are Othello, Iago, Desdemona, and Cassio (in that order). The plots beside show their line counts, average line length, 
            as well as the percentage of the words in the scene which they speak. Using the legend you can select which characters you would like to highlight (shift click to select multiple characters). 
            Interestingly looking at scene where both Othello and Iago speak we can see that out of the 11 scenes that they appear in together Othello speaks more in 6 of them. 
            However summing the words Othello speaks in this scene and diving by the sum of words both character speak in this scene shows that Othello speaks 45% of the words in their 
            shared scenes. This means that Iago is speaking more to Othello that Othello is to him. These numbers are congruent with the plot of the play as Iago needs Othello to listen 
            to his Iago’s lies about Cassio and Desdemona; the disparity between Othello speaking a greater number of scenes but Iago speaking a greater amount in their scenes exemplifies 
            Othello’s role as a reactor in the plot

        <div>
            <h2  style="text-align:center; font-weight: bold;"> Sentiment Analysis </h2> 
            <p style="text-align: center;  margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width:60%; text-align: justify;"> Sentiment analysis is a popular technique used in 
                natural language processing. A sentiment analyzer is a function which when given a sentence uses several machine learning techniques (naive bayes, maximum entropy, 
                and support vector machines) to classify a sentence as having positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. I am using a sentiment analyzer for python called VADER. 
                It is very powerful being able to handle negations (“not good”) and degree modifiers (“kinda good” vs “very good”).  I combines the positive, neutral, and 
                negative scores into one compound score which ranges from -1 to 1. Here are 2 example sentences from Othello. You can see in the second sentence even though “danger” 
                and “pity” are mentioned the analyzer is able to determine that the overall sentiment of the sentence is positive.</p>      
        </div>
        <div>   
            <img style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width:50%" src="sentiment_example.png" alt=""> 
      </div> 
        <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; padding: 20px;">
            <iframe 
                src="all_sentiment_points.html"

          </div>

          <p style="text-align: center;  margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width:60%; text-align: justify;"> While this graph does not show any clear trends in sentiment 
            analysis for the whole of Othello, I didn’t expect that it would. This visualization was more intended as a fun interaction piece as well as an introduction to the idea of 
            sentiment scores.  <br />
            Something interesting I noticed exploring this graph was the trend for shorter sentences in act 5 of Othello. As the plot is heating to it makes sense that characters would 
            start speaking faster, and with more urgency than the long prose of the previous acts. In fact the mean number of words in a sentence decreases for each act: starting at 12,
             then 11, 10, 8, and finally 7 in act 5.
            </p>
         
      <div>   
        <div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start; width: 70%; margin: 0 auto;">   
            <img style="width: 50%;" src="compound_cum_sentiment.png" alt="Cummulative sentiment scores for all sentences spoken by Iago and Othello"> 
            <p style="width: 50%; padding-left: 20px;"> Another reason that plotting all the sentiment scores on a graph fails to provide meaningful insight is the range for a sentiment score if from -1 (most negative) to 1 
                (most positive) which is not a wide range of values. If we accumulate sentiment scores for a character we can get an idea of the that character arc through their dialogue 
                as it progresses to more negative or positive sentiment. <br />
                This chart plots Iago and Othello’s cumulative sentiment thought the play. We can see how Iago starts the play taking his score into the negative as he tells the audience 
                about his hatred of Othello and Cassio, and then around the start of the second act we see it climb upwards as he puts his revenge into action and starts willing. 
                Conversely Othello starts the play on an upwards trajectory of sentiment but as Iago’s lies start to influences him and his speech until his sentiment falls beneath Iago’s 
                in act 4.
                </p>

  <div>   
    <div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start; width: 70%; margin: 0 auto;">   
        <img style="width: 50%;" src="neg_sentiment.png" alt="Cummulative sentiment scores for all sentences spoken by Iago and Othello"> 
        <p style="width: 50%; padding-left: 20px;">We see a similar trend in sentiment for Iago and Othello’s negative sentiment scores. Negative sentiment is between 0-1 for 
            each line so line for cumulative negative sentiment cannot go down. In this graph we can see that Othello’s negative sentiment has outpaced Iago’s by the end of the play. 
            In fact they both end the play at exactly a cumulative sum of 70 negative magnitude. <br />
            Often analysis of Othello thinks of him as the jealous party, but rather I think that Iago is the jealous one: jealous of Othello station, humility, and respect. 
            By the end of the play Iago has dragged Othello down to his jealous state, a reading that this sentiment analysis supports.             
            </p>

<div>   
    <div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start; width: 70%; margin: 0 auto;">   
        <img style="width: 50%;" src="char_10.png" alt="Cummulative sentiment scores for all sentences spoken by Iago and Othello"> 
        <p style="width: 50%; padding-left: 20px;">The word “Moor” is spoken by 10 unique characters in 52 times in Othello. For perspective the word “Cassio” is spoken by 
            10 unique characters, meaning that Othello is addressed as Moor by the same amount of characters who address Cassio in the play.<br />
            While the word Othello is spoken by 11 characters in the play, one of those characters is Othello himself. The refusal to call Othello by his name is the reminder 
            that even with his status as a general, his identity as a person of color will always other him from the  rest of the figures in the play.

            <p style="text-align: center;  margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width:50%; text-align: justify;"> When reading or watching Othello the audience can feel the disrespect 
                toward Othello from other characters. We can sense how he is given less room to speak, less respect from other characters, and how his mental state deteriators over the
                 course of the story. These trends are not just narrative but can be shown through an quanativie approach to analysing the text. <br />
                Othello despite being the titular character has speakers less than his antagonist Iago, and we can see how Iago’s speech infects Othello’s thinking as the negative 
                sentiment of Othello’s line increases as the play goes on. Othello despite having the play named after him is often not addressed by his name by the characters around 
                him. Othello is not afford the same space to express or respect that other characters like Hamlet or Richard the III are.

            <p style="text-align: center;  margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width:50%; text-align: justify;">For this analysis I am using the Folger Shakespeare Library's 
                downloadable txt version of the text. Which you can find <a href="https://www.folger.edu/explore/shakespeares-works/othello/read/">here</a>. I also used the Folger
                Librarys texts for counting Hamlet and Richard III's words in their respective plays.  <br />
                I then processed this txt into a csv file so I could process it through python’s date manipulation library (pandas) and a visualization library (altair). 
                I have 2 versions of the csv. One of them is divided by lines and the other is divided by sentences (I split the text any time there was a . ! or ?). 
                For the basic analysis like cumulative words spoken or mean line length I use the file divided by lines, but for the sentiment analysis I use the csv divided sentence 
                as the sentiment of a line can change sentence to sentence. As well sentiment analysis works better with shorter phrases. <br />
                Stage directions have been discarded.
